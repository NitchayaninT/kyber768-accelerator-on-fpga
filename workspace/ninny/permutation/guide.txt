Design (synthesizable Verilog)
    Pure hardware description: modules, regs/wires, always blocks, FSMs, etc.
    No #delays, no $display/$finish.
    This is what goes to synthesis/FPGA.

Testbench (non-synthesizable)
    Generates clock/reset and stimulus, captures/compares outputs.
    Can use initial blocks, #delays, $display, $finish, file I/O, randomization.
    Used only in simulation.

Permutation
1. Theta
- Input = State Array (1600 bits)
- Steps
    - Takes a Column from the state (columns 0-4, each column has 5 lanes and each lane has 64 bits)
    - Store a column[x,z] by XORing the bit position z within the same column
        - x = column number
        - z = bit position (from 0 - 63)
        - column[x,z] means column x at bit position z, it looks like a line with 5 bits, vertically
    - Then, calculate parity of the same bit position of 2 other columns 
        - Formula : D[x,z] = C[(x-1)mod5,z] XOR C[(x+1)mod5,(z-1)mod w]
    - Get the output by XORing the original bit from the state WITH the parity D[x,y]
    - A'[x,y,z] = A[x,y,z] XOR D[x,z]
    - Meaning, we XOR every bit WITHIN the column WITH the same parity
