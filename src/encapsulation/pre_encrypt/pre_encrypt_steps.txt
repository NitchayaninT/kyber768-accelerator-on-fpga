Inputs : 
- PK (Public key generated from keygen) = rho || t vector = 9472 bits
    - rho = 256 bits seed for public matrix (MSB)
    - t (PK's polynomial vector) = 9216 bits
- R = Random 256 bits

Outputs : 
- Plain text msg (m) = SHA3-256(R)
- (Coins, pre-k) = SHA3-512(SHA3-256(PK), m)
where m, coins, pre-k = 256 bits

What the outputs are used for
- coins = used as a seed for generating noise
- pre-k = used to derive a final shared key 
- m = plain text msg, use it to decode msg to get m(poly) -> use in addition
